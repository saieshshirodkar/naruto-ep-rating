Ebisu attempts to rally everyone's' spirits together in the event that rogue ninja should attack the village while their shinobi families are away at war, but the mothers scoff and claim that they will protect the village as they always have while their husbands fought. Suddenly Konohamaru is approached by several children, each claiming to have seen terrifying rogue ninja roaming the east and west forests outside Konoha. He tries to recruit his classmates into hunting them down, but they refuse to believe him. Konohamaru investigates the area alone with Moegi and Udon, only to find a traveling circus troupe in the forest instead of rogue ninja. Heading back, Konohamaru is again alerted that people are attacking the village on the west side, and this time, the rumors are true. A group of rogue Sumo Wrestlers attack the children, but they are saved by the mothers of Konoha, who fight back against the intruders. Konohamaru delivers the final blow with his Rasengan and saves the village.",
